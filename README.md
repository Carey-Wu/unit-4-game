# unit-4-game

This project assigns random values to a set of images that are used to try and match the value randomly assigned to a "patient".  You click on the images to try and match your value to the value of the patient.

This project shows the use of javascript to randomly assign values and the use of the Fisher Yates algorithm to shuffle numbers randomly.

Users can get started with this project by building their html and css to make things look how they would like.  Pick a game topic and build off that.  Then write a javascript file to randomly assign numbers to elements.  Googling methods on how to shuffle arrays will be helpful for randomly assigning numbers.
